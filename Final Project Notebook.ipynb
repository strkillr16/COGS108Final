    "# Overview\n",
    "In this final project of Data science, we are trying to generate a recommendation system of movies for IMDB users with the respect of their historical ratings. At first, after obtaining the datasets about both film's final ratings and individual users' ratings, we would try to combine them together with movieID as the key for further comparisons. Next, by visualizing the collected data, we would study the correlation between individual as well as final ratings of films and film genres. At last, we would use the model we generate to recommend films for each individual user. "

    "# Background \n",
    "Since the beginning of the 20th century, film has been an important recreation to human beings possessing both artistic and commercial significance. Moreover, in the Information Age, rather than being overwhelmed by the gigantic informative flow, film won unprecedented attention from the population with the aid of widespread accessibility to the Internet. Just like Hsu (2014) argued in his essay, in the era of Web 2.0, film critics are no longer privileges limited to professionals yet typical rights to common audiences as well, due to the introduction of film rating websites such as IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes: each audience could comment or grade films online and then share their evaluations and opinions to the public. Consequently, the data collected thereby is not only abundant in quantity, but also diverse in nature, including millions of users’ personal information as well as preference of films. Hence, considering it a perfect dataset to study users’ attributes to films, we would like to focus on the ratings on movie websites in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "As increasing audiences begin to consider online ratings as critical criteria to decide whether or  not to see a film, a number of data scientists struggle to explore the rating data, which has provided us with the direction of further research. In the research accomplished by Hsu (2014) focusing on predicting the movies user rating based on the IMDB attributes, by analyzing the ratings and critics of 31506 movies, they generated a mathematical model mimicking the manners of the preference of general IMDB users, and hence predicted the final rating of a newly coming movie via entering related parameters to it. Regardingly, we found that instead of being purely independent, the IMDB ratings of new films could be roughly predicted by past data. Furthermore, in Breuss’s research (2012), the personal information on users’ social media, including gender, hobby, or regular activities, was taken into account and therefore, predicted the IMDB movie ratings they might give, which inspires that individuals’ statistics could also be of concern. \n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, in this data science project, we will combine these two studies and step forward: we will study what kind of movies will a user like based on the historical ratings and review texts of that user on movies he/she has seen previously. From our perspective, this study is not only interesting but also quite applicable, could possibly promote the recommendation system in movie rating websites.\n",

    "# Hypothesis\n",
    "Within this data science group project, we would like to develope a recommendation systems for the movie rating websites which involves to predict the users' preference in movie according to their rating history and then provide them with certain genre of movies that they favour. Hence, we generated a couple of hypothesises with the respect of this topic:\n",
    "1. With the respect of the users, one would like to rate higher on the genres (higher than the average) he or she loves, which indicates his or her love. On the opposite, to the genres he or she dislikes, his or hers ratings would be much lower(lower than or equal to the average).\n",
    "2. Moreover, if a user loves a certain genre of film, he or she tends to watch more this genre of films.\n",
    "3. If a user loves a certain genre of film, this genre of film must exist among the films he or she rates the highest"
